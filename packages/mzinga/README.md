  <li>Use your own database and own your data</li>
  <li>It's just Express - do what you want outside of Payload</li>
  <li>No need to learn how Payload works - if you know JS, you know Payload</li>
  <li>No vendor lock-in</li>
  <li>Avoid microservices hell - get everything (even auth) in one place</li>
  <li>Never touch ancient WP code again</li>
  <li>Build faster, never hit a roadblock</li>
  <li>Both admin and backend are 100% extensible</li>
</ul>
