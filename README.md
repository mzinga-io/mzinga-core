<h3>Benefits over a regular CMS</h3>

  <li>Use your own database and own your data</li>
  <li>It's just Express - do what you want outside of Payload</li>
  <li>No need to learn how Payload works - if you know JS, you know Payload</li>
  <li>No vendor lock-in</li>
  <li>Avoid microservices hell - get everything (even auth) in one place</li>
  <li>Never touch ancient WP code again</li>
  <li>Build faster, never hit a roadblock</li>
  <li>Both admin and backend are 100% extensible</li>
</ul>

### TODO: rewrite the below section

## üóíÔ∏è Documentation

Check out the [Payload website](https://mzinga.io/docs/getting-started/what-is-payload) to find in-depth documentation for everything that Payload offers.

Migrating from v1 to v2? Check out the [2.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/mzinga-io/mzinga-core/releases/tag/v2.0.0) on how to do it.

## üôã Contributing

If you want to add contributions to this repository, please follow the instructions in [contributing.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## üìö Examples

The [Examples Directory](./examples) is a great resource for learning how to setup Payload in a variety of different ways, but you can also find great examples in our blog and throughout our social media.

If you'd like to run the examples, you can either copy them to a folder outside this repo or run them directly by (1) navigating to the example's subfolder (`cd examples/your-example-folder`) and (2) using the `--ignore-workspace` flag to bypass workspace restrictions (e.g., `pnpm --ignore-workspace install` or `pnpm --ignore-workspace dev`).

You can see more examples at:

- [Examples Directory](./examples)
